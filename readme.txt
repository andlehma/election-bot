"there are certainly projects which you have to get done in two weeks, nobody is going to use it in three weeks, does not matter" - rich hickey

i made this in 2 hours. nobody will use it in 1 week. i still tried to make it as simple as possible.
this is an extremely small project, but it exemplifies a lot of the principles of functional programming which i am trying to make habitual when writing code.

my github repos usually end up as time capsules for me. i like to go back and see what type of code i was writing and what projects i was working on. so here's some info for future readers (probably just me):
obviously this was written around the 2020 election. i am about 5 months in to my 6 month apprenticeship with ssi. i wish i would have written this in typescript, but i was trying to write it as fast as possible and i didn't feel like setting up the dev environment. i wish i could have written this in clojure, but there isn't a discord bot library for clojure. i'd like to write one. gotta learn clojure.
i wonder who's going to win this election.
